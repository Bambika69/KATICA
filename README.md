Llamas, alpacas, vicu単as, and guanacos are all members of the South American camelids family. Llamas and alpacas are domesticated, while vicu単as and guanacos are wild. Llamas and alpacas are two of the four lamoid species, with the other two species being vicu単a and guanaco, which are their wild cousins. Llamas are larger than alpacas and are used as pack animals in the Andean region, while alpacas have softer and more refined wool that is prized for its quality. Vicu単as are the national symbol of Peru and are considered graceful and shy in character. They are protected endangered species and are classed as wild.
